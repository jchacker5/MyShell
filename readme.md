# MyShell Project

## Author: Joseph Defendre

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a simple UNIX shell (command interpreter) in Java. The shell supports various built-in commands, providing a simple yet effective interface for file and text manipulation.

### Commands Supported

- `cat`: Output the contents of one or more files.
- `grep`: Read lines from piped input and output only those lines that contain a search string.
- `lc`: Read lines from piped input and output the number of lines.
- `history`: Displays the list of commands executed so far.
- `pwd`: Output the path of the current working directory.
- `ls`: Output the list of files in the current working directory.
- `cd`: Change to another directory.
- `exit`: Quit the command line.
- `!n`: Execute a previous command from history.

### How to Run

1. Compile the Java file: `javac MyShell.java`
2. Run the compiled Java program: `java MyShell`

### Error Handling

The shell provides basic error handling for unsupported or incorrect commands. Error messages are displayed to guide the user.
